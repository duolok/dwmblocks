# dwmblocks

Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

# Modifying blocks

The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.  Blocks are
added and removed by editing the config.h file. I have dwmblocks read my preexisting scripts.
So if you want my build out of the box, download those and put them in your
`$PATH`. I do this to avoid redundancy, both i3 and dwm use the same
statusbar scripts.
